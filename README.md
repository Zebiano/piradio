# PiRadio

Welcome!

This is a little project that turns any Pi (1, 2 and 3) into an FM Radio Transmitter.

The core of my project is markondej's project (https://github.com/markondej/fm_transmitter) to turn the Pi into a transmitter. But I felt that there should be an easier way to choose songs to play, stop the radio, etc so I decided to make a little interface for it. It should be pretty straight-forward, and I'm working on help files as well.

Keep in mind that this is still being worked on, and later on I plan to redo it all and use "dialog" (interface), but we all know how plans usually fail...
