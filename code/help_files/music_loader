.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the MusicLoader. Here you can download or import new songs into your music folder. It's also possible to do this manually: naviagte to /piradio/music/ and put your songs in there. But remember that the PiRadio only reads .wav files (not .mp3). That being said, there's an option that lets you convert .mp3 into .wav. I don't recommend trying to convert the files yourself, there's a slight chance that the PiRadio doesn't recognize them only to say they're corrupted.
